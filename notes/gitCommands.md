# Git Commands to Remember

## General Flow
- `git status` = find out what you did/changed.
- `git add <files> or .` = stage the commits. "I want to save these files in question.
- `git commit -m "<fancyMessage>"` = Label my changes. And add them to my git changelog.
- `git push` = send to Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab. You do this so if your laptop dies, you have your code still.

## Other notables
- `git log` = basically git status on steroids.
- `git checkout -B <branchName>` = you are making a new branch.
- `git pull` = give me the other changes. Will auto fold in if the changes are on the same branch. If not, ===>
- `git pull <branchName>` = Pulls in the branch into your local so you can resolve the merge conflicts and not be sad :)
